               <p>Bangladesh is home to classical as well as folk dance forms and music. Classical music is closely
                  related
                  to the Hindustani style, while the dance draws influences from other classical dance forms of the
                  Indian
                  subcontinent, especially Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi, and Manipuri. This nation also has a rich tradition

                  Folk music also has a recurring theme of love. The Sufi influence on the music of Bangladesh mentioned
                  above can be most prominently seen in Baul, which is a type of folk music. Rabindra sangeet, the songs
                  written and composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, is also an integral part of the culture of
                  Bangladesh.</p>
